# WEEK 15 
  
## FINAL PROJECT // Due 2018.12.10, 430-630pm  
**Use processing (code) as a medium for the generation of your own digital art and/or design work.  You can explore any idea or concept that interests you, though I'd encourage you to demonstrate a mastery of the programming techniques covered in this course.  You should feel free to explore the use of libraries and other algorithms (eg The Nature of Code), though be sure that you 1) reference them correctly, 2) understand their code base (if i ask a question about your code, i'd like you to be able to describe how you're using the library), and 3) develop the piece to the point that you've added your own unique perspective and contribution to the work (it shouldn't just look like one of the examples).**

things to turn in at the final:
```- your source code (zipped root folder with all assets)
- a txt document with your work's title and one or two sentences about the project
- properly commented source code (include the above description). as an example, please see
  https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML288/tree/master/CODE/WEEK13/atoms_ptIII 
- a single representative photo / screen capture (eg 1280x720 or 720x720). 
  if your had many iterations of your project that you liked, you optionally can 
  turn in a folder with multiple images.
- optional: consider turning video documentation/a screen video capture of your work (~720p).
  to create a screen capture, use quicktime player (new screen recording) and / or camera footage 
  (e.g. a camera pointed at you and the computer / projection screen).  if you're doing 
  physical prints (or some physical incarnation of the code), you may keep them after 
  the final review, but please turn in some good photos of the object(s).  
- optional: a link to any work posted to social media. 
```

final presentation:
```- an in-class demo of your final project
- Q&A from the class, and a discussion of your code (you should be able to talk about how  
  you built your project)
- you won't be graded on your presentation, though i will use it as an opportunity to 
  understand your depth of understanding of the code you've written.
```

please keep in mind from the syllabus:
```In general, you will be graded using these criteria:
- Conceptual Core: Is the workâ€™s thesis clearly articulated? Is the project productively 
  aligned with the weekly topic of discussion? Does the project effectively engage with 
  the primary issues presented in the assignment?
- Research Competence: Does the project display evidence of research and thoughtful 
  engagement with its subject?
- Form and Content: Do structural and formal elements of the code reinforce the conceptual 
  core in a productive way? Is the effectiveness of the project compromised by technical problems? 
- Creative Realization: Does the project approach its subject in creative or innovative ways? 
  Does the project use media and design principles effectively? Does the project use code 
  in an interesting way?
```
