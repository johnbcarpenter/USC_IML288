[Design I/O, _Connectd Worlds_ (2015)](http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/)  

_Connected Worlds_ (2015) is an incredible project that really pushes the boundaries on interactions with programmed systems and environments.  It's a great project to keep in mind (and be inspired by) while we start to work on _5/Input_ in Processing.

## Homework 04 // Due 2018.10.01
**Part I. Create a drawing tool**  
using some of the things we discussed in class today (_mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY_, easing, etc)      
_Size: 1280x720 pixels_   

**Part II. Prototype an interaction with some digital organism**  
_Some options: have the organism follow the mouse (easing? rotate?), move the organism around with the arrow keys, change the appearance or behavior of the organism on hover_  
_Size: 1280x720 pixels_
