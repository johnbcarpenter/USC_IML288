## Homework 04 // Due 2018.10.01
**Part I. Create a drawing tool**  
using some of the things we discussed in class today (_mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY_, easing, etc)  
    
_Size: 1280x720 pixels_  
  
**Part II. Prototype an interaction with some digital organism**  
_Some options: have the organism follow the mouse (easing? rotate?), move the organism around with the arrow keys, change the appearance or behavior of the organism on hover_  
  
_Size: 1280x720 pixels_
