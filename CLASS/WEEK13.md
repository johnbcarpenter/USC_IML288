- [in-class code examples](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML288/tree/master/CODE/WEEK13)  
- working session / individual discussions 

## Homework 09 + 10 // Due 2018.11.19  
revisit homework [09](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML288/blob/master/CLASS/WEEK09.md) + [10](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML288/blob/master/CLASS/WEEK10.md) and send in the _FINAL_ versions of them (if needed)  
  
While not an "official" homework, please turn in a WIP (work in progress) version of the work you're doing for the final project  
  
**FINAL PROJECT: Use processing (code) as a medium for the generation of your own digital art and/or design work.  You can explore any idea or concept that interests you, though I'd encourage you to demonstrate a mastery of the programming techniques covered in this course.  You should feel free to explore the use of libraries and other algorithms (eg The Nature of Code), though be sure that you 1) reference them correctly, 2) understand their code base (if i ask a question about your code, i'd like you to be able to describe how you're using the library), and 3) develop the piece to the point that you've added your own unique perspective and contribution to the work (it shouldn't just look like one of the examples).**

things to turn in at the final:
```- your source code (zipped root folder with all assets)
- a txt document with your work's title and one or two sentences about the project
- a single representative photo / screen capture (eg 1280x720 or 720x720). 
  if your had many iterations of your project that you liked, you optionally can 
  turn in a folder with multiple images.
- if your project is an animation, please turn in 30s to 2m of video documentation/screen 
  video capture (~720p). feel free to use screen capture (quicktime player... new screen 
  recording) and / or camera footage (e.g. a camera pointed at you and the computer / 
  projection screen). if you do something interactive, it's important to make sure you 
  show someone interacting with your work via the camera / 3D sensor. if you're doing 
  physical prints (or some physical incarnation of the code), you may keep them after 
  the final review, but please  turn in some good photos of the object(s).  keep in mind 
  that most of the world will probably only see your work through documentation, so make it good!
```

please keep in mind from the syllabus:
```In general, you will be graded using these criteria:
- Conceptual Core: Is the workâ€™s thesis clearly articulated? Is the project productively 
  aligned with the weekly topic of discussion? Does the project effectively engage with 
  the primary issues presented in the assignment?
- Research Competence: Does the project display evidence of research and thoughtful 
  engagement with its subject?
- Form and Content: Do structural and formal elements of the code reinforce the conceptual 
  core in a productive way? Is the effectiveness of the project compromised by technical problems? 
- Creative Realization: Does the project approach its subject in creative or innovative ways? 
  Does the project use media and design principles effectively? Does the project use code 
  in an interesting way?
```
