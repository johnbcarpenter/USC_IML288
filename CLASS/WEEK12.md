## Homework 10 // Due 2019.11.11  
**Continue to work on your own processing sketch based on Shiffman's implementation of the flocking algorithm.  Make sure the visuals are sufficiently different from the starting example. Cite the code correctly.**    

_Size: 1280x720 pixels or 720x720 pixels_  

**Develop a sketch for your final project in Processing OR another program like Illustrator, Sketch, or Photoshop OR a physical medium like a drawing or collage.  Please provide a link and/or images to any inspiration (aka visual or code references).**    

_Size: TBD, 1280x720 pixels or 720x720 pixels_
