**Part I. Recreate a Form and Color / Abstract Minimalist Artwork with Code**  
and think about draw order, color, form, shapes, fill, stroke.    
_Size: appropriate to the work and fits within 1280x720 pixels (e.g. a square work would be 720x720 pixels)_  

**Part II. Develop a Concept for Your Own Work**  
Inspired by Part I  
_Size: appropriate to the work and fits within 1280x720 pixels_
