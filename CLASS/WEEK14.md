## ~~Homework 11 // Due 2018.11.19~~  
**~~Develop a second draft of your final project in Processing. This could be 1 component of it in more detail, or a rougher overview of the whole project. If applicable (there's something new from last week) submit any notes, diagrams, inspiration references that are relevent to your final project in a folder inside the Processing sketch folder.~~**    

~~_Size: 1280x720 pixels or 720x720 pixels_~~  

**~~Continue to work on your own processing sketch based on Shiffman's implementation of the flocking algorithm.  Make sure the visuals are sufficiently different from the original example. Cite the code correctly.~~**
