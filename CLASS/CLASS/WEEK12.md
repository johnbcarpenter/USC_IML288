Use an array to either create a trail behind the mouse or behind several objects (the array would be within the class), and develop the visuals in an interesting way.

Size: 1280x720 pixels or 720x720 pixels

Expand your work from last week (Homework 08) to include an array to store and organize your objects. Feel free to create a new class to work with if you’ve already used an array on the previous assignment.
