## _4/Variables_ lecture
The aims of this lecture are to 1) learn how to create graphics that can easily be placed in different locations around your sketch -- at different sizes and with different colors, 2) think about how to work with some of the built in variables in processing (eg _width_ or _height_), and 3) explore using [random](https://processing.org/reference/random_.html) and a [for loop](https://processing.org/reference/for.html) to place a bunch of your graphics into a scene to create some larger design or texture.

## Homework 02 // Due 2018.09.17
**Part I. Generate a Graphic that can have Different Positions (x,y), Sizes and Colors**  
Try to move around your graphic and make it different sizes and colors, and figure out what variables you need to make that possible. Keep in mind the topics described in the previous _form + color_ lecture.  
_Size: appropriate to the work and fits within 1280x720 pixels (e.g. a square work would be 720x720 pixels)_  

**Part II. Use a "for loop" to Generate a Composition with a bunch (100?) Variations of Your Graphic**  
_Size: appropriate to the work and fits within 1280x720 pixels_  

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      // variable based code for your graphic goes here
    }
