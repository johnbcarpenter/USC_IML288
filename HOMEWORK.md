**Part II. Expand your work from last week (Homework 08) to include an array to store and organize your objects.**  
Feel free to create a new class to work with if youâ€™ve already used an array on the previous assignment.

# Week 12 (HW 10)  
**Part I. Develop a first draft of your final project in Processing.**  
This could be 1 component of it in more detail, or a rougher overview of the whole project. Submit any notes, diagrams, inspiration references that are relevent to your final project in a folder inside the Processing script.

**Part II. Install a library of your choice, use it to develop a processing sketch, that is sufficiently different from the original example**
...ideally this would serve your final project. Cite the code correctly.
